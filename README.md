## 🧠 Architecture

```
Java-Music-Player/
├── MusicPlayer.java       # Core logic for playback
├── GUI.java               # UI design and event handling
├── PlaylistManager.java   # Handles song list and switching
├── assets/                # (Optional) Icons/images
└── jl1.0.1.jar            # JLayer library (add manually)
```

## 🔍 How It Works

### 🧭 Flow Summary

1. User loads MP3s via file chooser
2. PlaylistManager stores file paths
3. Playback commands (play/pause/resume/stop) invoke `Player` object from JLayer
4. Swing updates the UI in real-time with song info

### 🎧 Playback Lifecycle

* Initializes a new Player thread per song
* Maintains control state (paused/stopped)
* Allows seamless transition between tracks
